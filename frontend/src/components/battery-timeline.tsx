        "Alessandro Volta invented the first true battery, the Voltaic Pile, consisting of alternating discs of zinc and copper with brine-soaked cloth between them. This discovery proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debunked the prevailing theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings.",
